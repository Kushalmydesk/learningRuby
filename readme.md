# Learning Ruby Basics

Welcome to the "Learning Ruby Basics" repository! This repository is designed to help you grasp the fundamentals of the Ruby programming language. Let's dive into the concepts covered so far.

## Introduction to Ruby

In this chapter, we begin by introducing the basics of Ruby programming. Let's start with printing a message using the `print` and `puts` methods.

### Printing a Message

To print a message in Ruby, you have a couple of options. The `print` method outputs the specified text on a single line, while the `puts` method adds a new line after printing.

Here's an example of using the `print` method to display the message "Hello World From Ruby":

```ruby
print("Hello World From Ruby")
```

Output:

```
Hello World From Ruby
```

To print on a new line, you can use the `puts` method:

```ruby
puts
```

Output:

```

```

The `puts` method without any argument creates a new line.

## Drawing a Shape

In this section, we explore drawing a shape using ASCII characters. Let's create a triangle shape:

```ruby
puts "      /|"
puts "     / |"
puts "    /  |"
puts "   /   |"
puts "  /____|"
```

Output:

```
      /|
     / |
    /  |
   /   |
  /____|
```

The code snippet above generates a triangular shape using ASCII characters.

## Conclusion
