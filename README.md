## Core Ruby: A Branching Roadmap
[![](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=ruby)](https://skillicons.dev)

**Progress:** 🟩🟩⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜

**1. Fundamentals:**  ✅

- Data Types 
    * ✔️Primitive types (numeric, boolean, nil) 
    * ✔️Non-primitive types (Array, Hash, String, Symbol) 
    * ✔️Type coercion and conversions 
- Variables & Operators 
    * ✔️Declaring and initializing variables
    * ✔️Arithmetic, relational, logical, and assignment operators 
* Control Flow 
    * ✔️`if`, `else`, `elsif`, `switch` statements for conditional branching 
    * ✔️`while`, `until`, `for` loops for iteration 
* Methods 
    * ✔️Defining and invoking methods 
    * ✔️Parameters, return values, method overloading 
    * ✔️Method chaining 
* Classes & Objects 
    * ✔️Understanding object-oriented principles 
    * ✔️Class definition and members (attributes, methods) 
    * ✔️Object creation and instantiation 
    * ✔️Member access using the `.` operator 

**2. Strings: ✅**
-  String class: 
    * ✔️Essential methods for manipulation (e.g., `length`, `chars`, `slice`, `concat`, `index`) 
-  String immutability: 
    * ✔️Understanding that strings are immutable; creating new instances for modifications 

**3. Arrays: ✅**
-  Declaring and Creating 
    * ✔️Defining arrays with data types and sizes 
    * ✔️Initializing elements using literal values or loops
-  Accessing Elements 
    * ✔️Using indices to access and modify elements within bounds 
-  Multidimensional Arrays 
    * ✔️Creating arrays with more than one dimension 
    * ✔️Nested access using multiple indices 


**4. Advanced OOP Concepts:❇**

- Inheritance: 
    * ✔Single inheritance: Extending parent classes, method overriding using `super` keyword
- Modules & Mixins: 
    * Defining contracts for classes to implement, enforcing specific behaviors
- Encapsulation: 
    * Data hiding and access control with public, private, protected modifiers
- Abstract classes and interfaces: 
    * Providing partial implementation and enforcing specific methods in subclasses

**5.Input/Output:❇️**
* ✔Standard I/O: `STDIN`, `STDOUT`, `STDERR` for user input and output, using `gets` and `puts` for basic I/O
* File I/O: Reading and writing data from files using `File`, `IO` classes

**6. Collections:❌**

* Adding, Removing, Accessing Elements (partially completed)✅
    * Using appropriate methods for Hashes (partially completed)
* Advanced Techniques
    * Iterators and enumerables
    * Sorting and searching
    * Set operations

**7. Modules & Namespaces:❌**
* Organizing classes into logical groups
* Using modules for namespacing and mixins
* Accessing methods and constants using the `::` operator

**8. Access Modifiers:❌**
* `public`, `private`, `protected`, and `default` access control
* Controlling visibility and encapsulation of methods and attributes
**9. Importing:❌**
* Using `require` and `require_relative` to import files
* Understanding module resolution and paths

**10. Exporting and Sharing:❌**
* Public methods vs. private methods
* Using modules and namespaces for organization
* Sharing code through gem creation

**11. Exception Handling:❌**

* Try-catch-finally: Handling runtime errors gracefully
* Throwing and Catching Exceptions
* Common Exceptions


**12. Package Management:❌**
- **RubyGems:**
    * Key features: installation, version management, dependency resolution
    * Resources: https://rubygems.org/doc/
- **Bundler:**
    * Key features: project-specific dependencies, Gemfile management
    * Resources: https://bundler.io/
-  Essential tasks:
    * Searching for gems
    * Installing, updating, and removing gems
    * Managing dependencies
-  Additional resources:
    * RVM: https://rvm.io/
    * FPM: https://fpm.sh/



**🔭 Metaprogramming:**

* Modifying code at runtime
* Dynamic object creation and inspection

**🔭 Web Development:**

- Web frameworks  
    * ❤️Rails 
    * Sinatra
* Building web applications with Ruby

**🔭GUI Development:**

* GUI frameworks like Tk and Shoes
* Building desktop applications with Ruby

**🔭Network Programming:**

* Using sockets and HTTP libraries for network-based applications
